## Getting Started
Run `live-server` to start web server

## Current Plan
Ryokan is a 2D metaverse application with nostalgic RPG components. Ryokan's aim is to be a fulfilling experience 
without needing too much time to be invested. 

Ryokan will provide in-game widgets to track habits and goals such as exercise, sleep, healthy eating, reflection, etc. 
Continued good habits will level up your in-game character in stats such as physical, mental, perserverance, etc. and these 
stats will help with in-game quests and missions. Game mechanics will consist of base-stats as well as a luck/dice component.

**In-summary:** Ryokan is a 2D metaverse habit tracker and RPG where your character levels up with progress in your real-life.
